We are building a solution to the Kaggle Zillow challenge described here:
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1

The data may be downloaded here:
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data

and for this project we used the 2016 data. The data files of interest are
- The properties file: https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/download/properties_2016.csv.zip
- The transactions: https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/download/train_2016_v2.csv.zip
- The data dictionary: https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/download/zillow_data_dictionary.xlsx.zip

The solution is implemented in Python 2.7.12, and a working Python environment will include the following libraries:
- operator
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- pandas
- xgboost
- sklearn.preprocessing
- scipy.stats
