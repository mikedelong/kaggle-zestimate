Udacity Machine Learning capstone project proposal
==================================================
This is a proposal to solve a problem from a Kaggle competition to fulfill the capstone project requirements for the Udacity nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer.

I was working in financial services in 2007, when the 2007-2008 financial crisis began. It began systemically many years earlier, with an escalation in housing prices, which fueled an expectation that home values could only go up. Because of the dislocation the crisis caused in the economy, and because I personally suffered a cash loss that I would prefer not to characterize, I continue to be interested in rational house prices.

    The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
    A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
    The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
    A solution statement — a the solution proposed for the problem given;
    A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
    A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
    An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
